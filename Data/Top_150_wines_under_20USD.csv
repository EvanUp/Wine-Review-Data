Rulo 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,96,"Superb fruit highlights this tight, sculpted Syrah. It's extremely dense, with deep and intense raspberry and cassis fruit flavor, augmented with coffee grounds, smoke and iron filings. Complex, detailed, balanced and deep—what more can a wine give you? This is drinking very young and surely needs to be decanted. But already displaying amazing power.",Syrah
Dunham 2010 Lewis Estate Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,95,"Truly stunning, the Lewis Estate Riesling from Dunham explodes with fragrant fruits—citrus, melon and tropical. A symphony of subtle accents, such as powdered sugar, candied citrus peel and breakfast tea, this gorgeous bottle belongs with the short list of the very best of Washington's many Rieslings.",Riesling
Alain Brumont 2010 Château Bouscassé Red (Madiran),20,95,"The home vineyard of Madiran's star, Alain Brumont, has yielded a superb wine that is full of dark tannins and with a considerable ability to age. It is balanced, concentrated and touched by spice and toastiness from the wood aging. In tandem with that are generous fruits within a dense structure that is just beginning to smooth out. Drink from 2018–2038.",Red Blend
Januik 2012 Bacchus Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,95,"Spectacular is the word that comes to mind here. Tasted over many hours, this stunning effort proved itself over and over. A mix of citrus oils, tree fruits, a hint of honey, tea, lemon verbena and more, it delivers astonishing complexity and flavor for such a young wine. It should continue to evolve and improve from 2024–2034.",Riesling
Poet's Leap 2009 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,95,"With residual sugar at about 1.35%, this balances the acidity without seeming sweet. Hand-picked and whole-cluster pressed, this immaculate, fresh, generous and stylish Riesling is always at the top of the list of Washington's best. Loaded with grapefruit, citrus and stone flavors, it cleans the palate and piles on the details as it rolls into a finish that lingers for well over a full minute.",Riesling
Stottle 2011 Lucille Late Harvest Viognier (Yakima Valley),18,94,"This tastes like a more concentrated and sweeter version of Stottle's dry Viognier from the same vintage and vineyard. Deeply concentrated, complex and creamy, it's loaded with citrus and stone fruits, honey and butterscotch, yet remains lifted by defining acidity.",Viognier
Brian Carter Cellars 2009 Opulento Dessert Wine Touriga-Souzao-Tinto Cão Port (Yakima Valley),20,94,"Opulento is made entirely- with authentic Portuguese varieties, based on 60% Touriga Nacional. It's truly Port-like in flavor, showing deep notes of black cherry and cassis fruit. Smooth and supple, this is thoroughly delicious and should not be missed.",Port
Château Vignelaure 2016 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),20,94,"This is one of the classics among Provence rosés. Produced from organically grown grapes and coming from an impressive red-wine producing estate east of Aix-en-Provence, the wine is structured and ageworthy with its blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon. Rich and full of red fruits, the wine should be drunk from late 2017.",Rosé
Osborne NV Pedro Ximenez 1827 Sweet Sherry Sherry (Jerez),14,94,"A spectacularly sweet and rich bruiser, and one that delivers the essence of raisins, toffee and chocolate. This wine hasn't taken one turn south, and it's beckoning to be consumed. The finish is impeccably smooth and rich, and while its luscious to say the least, the amazing thing is its length, which runs a couple of minutes, no joke. A guarantee for anyone who loves the hedonistic combination of sweet fruit, brown sugar and chocolate.",Sherry
Domaine Marcel Deiss 2011 White (Alsace),20,94,"This wine is made from a mix of 13 different grape varieties in a field blend. It's a totally terroir driven wine, full of mineral and gritty textures in its youth. Behind this structure is a wild range of flavors—spice, apples, pears and apricots—waiting to show through. It needs to age, so drink from 2016.",White Blend
Quinta dos Murças 2011 Assobio Red (Douro),13,94,"Assobio is from a single vineyard in the Quinta dos Murças estate. A powerful, structured expression of Douro wine, it has black fruits, dark tannins, some subtle layers of wood aging and great concentration. Dark and richly fruity, it needs to mature before drinking. Wait until 2017.",Portuguese Red
Le Casematte 2014 Peloro Red (Terre Siciliane),20,94,"Made with 70% Nerello Mascalese and 30% Nocera, this has enticing scents of mature red berry, pressed blue flower, tilled soil and a whiff of crushed stone.

Drink 2020–2030.",Red Blend
Alma Rosa 2006 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),20,94,"Starts with an opulent, inviting aroma of smoky honey, vanilla, tangerines, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots, green apples and minerals. In the mouth, the flavors are very similar—an explosion of fruits, spices and toast. Just a tremendous wine, but for all the volume and complexity, it's completely balanced.",Chardonnay
Timothy Malone 2016 Medici Vineyard Riesling (Chehalem Mountains),20,94,"In 2016, Tim Malone has cut back on the residual sugar, dropping it down to 12 g/L, meaning the wine is just slightly off dry. The old-vine flavors rock on through, delivering big bursts of honeydew, grapefruit and lime, underscored by minerals. The depth, length and succulent drinkability are sublime.",Riesling
Domaine Cauhapé 2011 Symphonie de Novembre  (Jurançon),18,94,"A rich, sweet wine that maintains complete freshness. Pineapple, peach and mango compose the fruit, while the honey and touch of botrytis give the sweetness. It has a refreshing youthful character, but it's going to be a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",Petit Manseng
D'Arenberg 2008 The Noble Wrinkled Riesling (McLaren Vale),19,94,"Lovely dessert-style Riesling at an extremely attractive price.

Should last through at least 2016.",Riesling
Poet's Leap 2012 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,94,"Half of this year's Poet's Leap Riesling is sourced from The Benches, one quarter from old-vine plantings at Dionysus, and the rest from Yakima's Phil Church vineyard. Marvelous concentration and a panoply of lush orange, apricot, peach and papaya flavors carry this beautifully balanced wine through a long and satisfying finish. Delicious young, it could also be cellared for a decade or longer.",Riesling
Guardian 2012 Angel Sauvignon Blanc (Red Mountain),20,94,"This is as good as Sauvignon Blanc gets in Washington—a dense, pungent, intensely aromatic and gloriously flavorful wine sourced entirely from the Klipsun Vineyard. Inaugural scents suggest wet hay, new-mown grass, fig and citrus. Following are flavors of pineapple, more citrus, beeswax and a suggestion of bee pollen. This is one of those bottles that empties much faster than you'd like.",Sauvignon Blanc
Domaines Dominique Piron 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Moulin-à-Vent),20,94,"Wonderful old vines facing south and south-east give a powerfully tannic, structured wine.

Dunham 2009 Lewis Estate Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,94,"Even by Dunham's high standards, this is a spectacular Riesling. A little spritz to give it a turbo start, a textural and focused entry, a broad splash of spicy apple, pear, apricot and light tropical fruit, and then a surprising streak of honeyed almonds. This wine just rocks.",Riesling
Uvaggio 2010 Secco Moscato Giallo (Lodi),16,94,"This dry Moscato Giallo from Lodi is delicious, with an intensely perfumed nose that follows through in the taste, alongside Meyer lemon, jasmine and cantaloupe. Very unusual, incredibly well priced and modest in alcohol, this lush, ginger-tinged Moscato is this taster's desert-island white.",Moscato Giallo
Geyerhof 2016 Rosensteig Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),20,94,"An immensely savory nose immediately hints at an intense wine, with salty miso and tangy, peppery arugula. The palate turns the flavor volume up, with the spicy intensity brightened by lemon freshness and a textured but toned body. A stony saltiness edged with white pepper makes this moreish and irresistible for a lasting, powerful but very authentic Grüner experience.",Grüner Veltliner
David Hill 2013 Estate Riesling (Willamette Valley),18,94,"A gorgeous, rich and aromatic Riesling, this is a tribute to the expressive dimensions that old vines can provide (these were planted in 1965). Ripe, lush citrus fruits, tangerine, spicy pekoe tea and hints of tropical fruit all come into play. It's a pure, lengthy, utterly delicious wine offering excellent value.",Riesling
Dunham 2011 Lewis Estate Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,94,"As consistent as ever, this is sleek and stylish, with complex, layered flavors of citrus rind, citrus flesh and delicate tropical fruits. There are further highlights of honeycomb and dried apricot, and mouth-pleasing, underlying minerality.",Riesling
Kevin White 2011 La Fraternité Red (Yakima Valley),20,94,"A blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah, this is right up there with the best of Maison Bleue for a southern-Rhône-style blend from Washington. Lovely aromatics introduce a forward, fruit-powered wine loaded with scents and flavors of ripe cherries and plums. The red fruits are enhanced with hints of tobacco and mineral, but the lollipop fruit core is what captivates through a long finish.",Rhône-style Red Blend
Eichinger 2014 Vm Berg Riesling (Kamptal),18,94,"A little air is all that is needed to shake the orange and lemon zest flavors awake. This is a feast of ripe citrus: crisp, slender and very, very appetizing. The palate is streamlined and full of drive, with added complexity and texture from lees. Keep sipping to taste all the nuances of citrus—yuzu, tangerine, lemon and bergamot. This poised, pure beauty is delicious now but will last. Drink now till 2025.",Riesling
Poet's Leap 2007 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,94,"Loaded with honeysuckle, melon, pear, peach and hints of sweet grapefruit, this juicy wine perfectly captures the intensity of Washington Riesling and the complexity of German wines. Buoyant and precise, with notes of chalk and limestone in the finish, this is a stunning achievement in a challenging vintage.",Riesling
Joseph Carr 2009 Dijon Clone Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),18,94,"Vintner Carr follows up on his great 2008 Reserve with this delicious bottling. In California, it's usually a cinch to get fruit this ripe and tropical, and easy to plaster on lots of new oak. What's hard is to fuse the elements seamlessly. This wine does, offering waves of Chardonnay opulence. It may have a touch of botrytis, but that's in its favor.",Chardonnay
José Maria da Fonseca 2015 José de Sousa Red (Alentejano),20,94,"Named after the Fonseca estate in Alentejo, this wine is impressively rich and structured. It has firm tannins that are balanced by dense black fruits and crisp acidity.

It's still maturing, so drink from 2019.",Portuguese Red
Le Fraghe 2015 Brol Grande  (Bardolino),20,94,"Showing Bardolino's more serious side, this delicious red opens on aromas of wild berry, pressed blue flower, spice and a balsamic note.

Drink through 2019.",Red Blend
Alain Brumont 2009 Château Bouscassé Red (Madiran),20,94,"Bouscassé is the home estate of Alain Brumont, who also owns Château Montus. The wine may be six years old, but it is still dark and very firm. Dense tannins still show strongly over the tarry black fruits. Just wait and this wine will reveal its richness and smoothness while never losing concentration. Drink from 2018.",Red Blend
Château du Cèdre 2012 Cèdre Héritage Malbec (Cahors),20,94,"From one of the top estates in Cahors, this complex, dense wine is both structured and packed with great fruit. At the moment, the tannins are in charge, big, bold and dense. Over the next few years the opulent black fruits will come out strongly, bringing richness along with impressive concentration. Drink from 2019.",Malbec
Michael David 2012 Petite Petit Petite Sirah (Lodi),18,94,"Don't let the cartoony label fool you, this is fantastic wine. The color is almost black to the rim, the aromas are meaty and peppery, and the flavors are very concentrated. The texture is thick and yet creamy with layered, smooth and bold tannins. For all its density and depth, however, this is not an overpowering monster. The blackberry and black pepper notes are rich and appealing and everything seems in balance for something this robust and full bodied. Drink now through 2027. It's blended with 15% Petit Verdot.",Petite Sirah
Château Vignelaure 2015 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),20,93,"Coming from a remote estate on the edge of the Lubéron mountains in the north of Provence, this wine is impressively rich.

Mouchão 2012 Ponte das Canas Red (Alentejo),20,93,"From the historic Herdade do Mouchão in northern Alentejo, this is a powerful wine, full of dense tannins and impressively ripe, juicy black fruits.

Bibbiano 2010  Chianti Classico,20,93,"A lovely, wine, with aromas of red cherry, violet and hints of underbrush.

Drink 2016–2025.",Red Blend
Wines & Winemakers 2009 Aguia Moura em Vinhas Velhas Reserva Red (Douro),18,93,"This is a smooth, impressively rich wine powered by silky tannins and ripe black fruits.

Castellinuzza e Piuca 2010  Chianti Classico,16,93,"This gorgeous Chianti Classico boasts lively cherry, strawberry and violet aromas.

A textbook Chianti Classico.",Red Blend
Gruber Röschitz 2012 Hundspoint Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),17,93,"Grapefruit zest dominates this wine right now, but ripe honeydew melon also is shining though. As the wine opens up, it also reveals peppery, tangy spice and a refreshingly clean finish.",Grüner Veltliner

Pleasant notes of smoke and salt linger on the finish.",Shiraz
Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2011 Red (Beira Atlantico),20,93,"From the coastal plain of the Beiras, this cool and structured blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional has a fine poise between acidity and sweet berry fruits. It's a complex, textured wine. Fresh and fruity on the one hand and dark and brooding on the other, it needs time, so drink from 2017.",Portuguese Red
Quinta da Rede 2012 Reserva Red (Douro),18,93,"French oak aging has given this still-young wine a firmly structured character, with dark tannins and a firm texture. It's still very dry, structured and dark and needs a good few years to age and round out. For now, the ripe fruit and acidity are both showing great promise. Drink from 2018.",Portuguese Red
Domäne Wachau 2015 Terrassen Federspiel Riesling (Wachau),19,93,"Another study in citrus: bergamot peel mixes with fragrant citrus foliage on the nose. The palate brings further harmony with notes of orange and tangerine. The juicy freshness is utterly mouthwatering. The dry, slender palate is seriously playful and playfully serious. Only Riesling can achieve this. Utter joy and supreme refreshment.",Riesling
Eichinger 2015 Wechselberg Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),20,93,"Aloe vera balminess is promised on the zesty, aromatic nose. The palate fulfills this easily: this is supple and flowing, concentrated and fluid. White pepper, grapefruit zest, juicy pear and greenish leafiness all gather around the central seam of freshness. Elegance, poise and total refreshment is the result.",Grüner Veltliner
Sleight of Hand 2012 The Magician Evergreen Vineyard White Wine Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),18,93,"This is 100% Riesling, but with less than half the residual sugar of the winery's 2011 vintage.

Dionysos 2014 Moschofilero (Mantinia),16,93,"Vanilla, citrus and white flowers on the nose lead this memorable white from mainland Greece. The overall character is linear and crisp, with lemon and limestone flavors interlaced with exotic fruits and rose. A wine with class and character that will offer diverse food pairing experiences.",Moschofilero
Simonsig 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),15,93,"This big boy greets us with his deep ruby/black cloak. Loaded with cassis from start to finish, there is tremendous fruit depth here and a full, supple mouthfeel. Reminiscent of one of the successful large-scale ‘97 California Cabernets. Has tannins to resolve, best held for a year or two.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Berger 2015 Lössterrassen Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),20,93,"Zesty lime and green fern aromas rise from the glass. The palate merely adds a little green pear fruit to this refreshing and enlivening combo of utter cleanness and verve. The linearity and drive make this moreish, very exciting and totally lip-smacking. Echoes of pepper on the aftertaste make it even more intriguing.",Grüner Veltliner
Cameron Hughes 2013 Lot 457 Meritage (Napa Valley),18,93,"Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot inform the full-bodied flavors in this stunner. It shines in its luxuriously velvety texture, bright red fruit and intriguing elements of graphite and tar. Big and bold, it betrays its size with unexpectedly elegant tension and focus.",Meritage
Jax 2015 Y3 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),20,93,"This is a remarkable effort at the price, the wine sourced from Beckstoffer-owned sites in Carneros. Apple, peach and lemon highlight an integrated, vibrantly fresh experience on the palate, which lingers and impresses long after the finish.",Chardonnay
Rui Roboredo Madeira 2012 Beyra Superior Red (Beira Interior),20,93,"Structured and still very young, this richly exuberant wine is bursting to get beyond its tannins. The black fruits and dark texture are piled high and laced with intense acidity. It has the mineral character that seems often to appear in wines from the remote, mountainous Beira Interior, giving the potential for considerable aging. Drink from 2018.",Portuguese Red
Timothy Malone 2015 Medici Vineyard Riesling (Chehalem Mountains),20,93,"This is a deep, intense and focused wine sourced from 40-year-old vines. Its 28 g/l of residual sugar is all but buried in bright acids, creating tension and depth. Grapefruit, lime and pineapple flavors burst through, making this highly cellar-worthy wine irresistible already.",Riesling
Trimbach 2015 Riesling (Alsace),20,93,"The faintest hint of zesty lemon appears on the nose. The dry palate is of a concentrated slenderness, showing intense notes of ripe lemon zest but hinting at richer notions of ripe pear and candied citron. There is real impact, guided by rapier-like freshness and utter precision. This has an almost cleansing quality but is nonetheless imbued with the fruitful generosity of 2015. Lovely now, but sure to develop. Drink now through 2027.",Riesling
Domaine Jean Sipp 2015 Réserve Riesling (Alsace),17,93,"Sun-warmed ripe mirabelle notes beckon on the nose. The palate edges them with wonderful lemon zestiness.

The finish is whistle clean and lasting with pure lemon.",Riesling
Wines & Winemakers 2012 Pegos Claros Vinhas Velhas Reserva Castelão (Palmela),18,93,"A serious and dense wine, this is rich and full of dark juicy fruit.

Drink this concentrated wine from 2018.",Castelão
Smith & Hook 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),18,93,"This is a big but balanced expression of Cabernet that is ready to drink now. Layers of black cherry, caramel, vanilla, smoke and crushed black rocks show on the lavish nose.

Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Oloroso Sherry Sherry (Jerez),17,93,"More sweet than semi-sweet, and very stylish. The nose offers a full blast of maple, citrus rind and honey, while the delicious palate overflows with dried apricot, fig, dates, pepper and chocolate. This is a sherry that excels in the area of mouthfeel: it's lithe, almost lean, but still packed and upright. And the finish, which is just spicy enough to offset the sweetness, goes on forever.",Sherry
Sokol Blosser 2012 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),19,93,"This is a powerful wine, with intense scents of pineapple leading a lively interplay of citrus, stone, Asian pear and spices. Thrilling texture, balance and length make this a standout, even in this outstanding vintage for all Pinot Gris.",Pinot Gris
Syncline 2009 Coyote Canyon Vineyard Viognier (Horse Heaven Hills),20,93,"A lush mouthful of nuanced fruit, this single-vineyard Viognier is loaded with a rich mix of peach, apricot, papaya and guava fruit.

Efeste 2012 Evergreen Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,93,"Dry and crisply detailed, this delicious, bracing Riesling combines refreshing minerality with delicate yet complex fruit flavors of apple, pear and tangerine. It's full-bodied and drinking beautifully, but has the structure to develop over a decade or more. You decide whether to enjoy it now or tuck it away.",Riesling
Fife 2004 L'Attitude 39 Red (Mendocino),18,93,"L'Attitude needs a warm vintage to succeed, and it got one in '04. The wine, a blend of Carignane, Syrah and other Rhône reds, is dry and complicated, offering rich, earthy, Provençal herb flavors with fruitier tastes of cherries, blackberries and cola. Notable for balance, elegance and power. Drink now through 2010.",Rhône-style Red Blend
Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Amontillado Sherry (Jerez),20,93,"This is sweet Amontillado in fine form. The nose is centered around a core of molasses and brown sugar, while the palate bubbles with maple and toffee. Yes, it's a sweeter-styled Amontillado, but the sugar fades on the palate, leaving only the complex residue of caramel, espresso and burnt cinnamon. A lovely wine for any fan of serious Sherry.",Sherry
Quinta de Chocapalha 2011 Tinto Red (Lisboa),18,93,"Aged for 18 months in wood, this impressive ripe wine is full of fruit and also a firm, smoky tannic structure.

So, being fans of follies, the family named this spicy wine after the house. This wine is dense and concentrated, with dark fruit balanced by structured tannins. Drink now–2022.",Touriga Nacional
Alma Rosa 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),19,93,"Ripe aromas of passionfruit, kiwi and nectarine rise alongside greener elements of celery stalk, wet thyme and Granny Smith apple on this promising early look at the vintage.

Milziade Antano 2012  Montefalco Rosso,20,93,"A blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot, this bold wine conveys earthy aromas of blackberry, leather, tilled soil and a balsamic note.

The flavors of fruit and forest just keep unfolding through a lingering finish.",Pinot Gris
Schloss Gobelsburg 2014 Riesling (Kamptal),20,93,"Beautifully pure apple fruit plays on nose and palate. Citrus juice frames the fruit and heightens the freshness even more. If you like a slender, supercrisp style of Riesling, the purity of this will have you hooked.",Riesling
Meinklang 2015 Blauburgunder (Burgenland),19,93,"Juicy, vivid black cherry fruit appears on the nose of this wine, with a touch of tar and brooding elderberry.

Nittnaus Anita und Hans 2014 Kalk und Schiefer Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),20,93,"A touch of promising reduction still colors the ripe and aromatic blueberry notes on the nose. The palate shows exactly what makes Blaufränkisch so sexy: that telltale mix of blueberry, cherry and tingling white pepper. Precise in its fruit and fine tannic structure, the wine has purity, toned muscle and verve, with a freshness and illuminating brightness that makes it both fresh and elegant. The finish rings with all the peppery glory of this variety.",Blaufränkisch
Hermann J. Wiemer 2015 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),19,93,"Wiemer's standard dry Riesling is an impeccable value for a wine that offers such density of fruit and minerality. While dry in style, it's a luscious, deeply fruity wine studded with tangerine and stone-fruit flavors glazed in honey and nectar. It's unctuous and ripe, but finishes with a cool, steel-edged persistence.",Riesling
Paltrinieri 2016 Radice  (Lambrusco di Sorbara),20,93,"This vibrant, slightly sparkling wine is one of the best Lambrucos out there. Made entirely from the Sorbara variety, it opens with enticing citrus, woodland berry and wildflower scents. Its crisp, delicious palate doles out strawberry and pink grapefruit notes alongside baking spice accents and racy acidity. The lees that have settled at the bottom of the bottle gives the last glass even more flavor.",Lambrusco di Sorbara
Marquis Philips 2000 Sarah's Blend Red (South Eastern Australia),15,93,"Writes the book on how to make a wine filled with gigantic jammy fruit that's nonetheless dry, balanced and harmonious. The Cabernet contributes blackcurrants and structural tannins. The Syrah brings a peppery richness, while Merlot adds soft fruitiness. You can actually taste each varietal, yet the wine hangs together, dry and rich. Best Buy.",Red Blend
Château Capbern 2014  Saint-Estèphe,20,93,"Packed with the dark tannins and structure of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine, produced by the team of Calon Ségur is intense, concentrated and dark.

Ouled Thaleb 2012 Médaillon Red (Zenata),18,93,"Aromas of black cherry, espresso bean and white chocolate tease the palate in this Moroccan blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah.

Claudia Springs 1998 Eagle Point Ranch Zinfandel (Mendocino),20,93,"Zin with a Pinot sensibility; it's bright, spicy and forward. Sweet, delicious fruit, with accents of cinnamon, cardamom and anise. This is an elegant and subtle wine, but unusually long and complex, with wonderful structure. Enticing, enchanting wine.",Zinfandel
Dão Sul 2007 Casa de Santar Touriga Nacional Touriga Nacional (Dão),20,93,"The Dão region has some superb expressions of Touriga Nacional and this is one of them. With its richly perfumed fruit, dusty tannins, spiced damson and blueberry flavors, this is a great wine, ready for drinking in another 4–5 years.",Touriga Nacional

Dutton Estate 2006 Dutton Ranch Kylie's Cuvée Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),17,93,"Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors.

Gainey 2014 Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),19,93,"This wine is full of lovely aromas and flavors, but something unique about its grippy texture makes it soar.

Uvaggio 2009 Vermentino (Lodi),14,93,"Uvaggio is making a serious case for Lodi Vermentino.

Two Vintners 2013 Make Haste Cinsault (Yakima Valley),20,93,"This is a rare, 100% varietal Cinsault from Olsen Vineyard that saw only neutral French oak, and it's hard to imagine a more pure representation of the variety.
