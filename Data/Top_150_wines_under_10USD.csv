Quinta do Portal 2007 Mural Reserva Red (Douro),10,91,"A firm wine, based on dry tannins and some dense fruit. It has acidity, driven by black berry flavors. The core of the wine is dry, both from wood and acidity, and it will benefit from 2–3 years' aging.",Portuguese Red
José Maria da Fonseca 2007  Moscatel de Setúbal,10,91,"Orange peel aromas emerge on this delectable fortified Moscatel. Aging in barrel for at least three years has given it roundness and some old toast character that adds to the dried raisin and apricot flavors. Not for aging, drink now.",Moscatel
Snoqualmie 2006 Winemaker's Select Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),8,91,"With full ripeness, density and concentration, this keeps its superb balance at just 10.8% alcohol and 5% residual sugar.

Lujon 2015 Riesling (Willamette Valley),10,91,"This contends for the best $10 Riesling in the country. It's off dry, with 30g/L of residual sugar, but not too sweet for some Asian noodle entrées.

Quinta do Casal Branco 2004 Red (Ribatejo),10,91,"The estate wine from Casal Branco is impressive and structured, with dried berry fruits, dark, dry tannins and a solid structure.

Chateau de l'Oiselinière 2014 Les Grands Gâts Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),10,91,"This is a wine that, unlike many Muscadets, can age well.

Johann Donabaum 2015 Point Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),10,91,"The ripe, appetizing zestiness of Amalfi lemon peel, paired with a green streak of lime and herb conquers nose and palate immediately.

Taut and precise texture with a long, slightly austere finish.",Alsace white blend
Cookies & Cream 2010 Merlot (California),10,90,"One of a string of great values made at Terravant near Santa Barbara. Attractively oaky, it's full-bodied, full-flavored and just tannic enough to make it a good pairing for rich meat or cheese courses. It is deep in color, with a slightly tawny rim. It smells like wood smoke and grilled bread, tastes deep as blackberry and delivers cherry flavors that linger on the finish.",Merlot
Esser Cellars 2001 Chardonnay (California),8,90,"A rich, opulent wine at an unbelievable price, this Chard has layers of ripe peaches, pears and tropical fruits, and a lush overlay of toasty oak.
