Domaines Schlumberger 2014 Saering Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),29,96,"A touch of lemon balm adds a breezy freshness to the nose, while a pure, bright and precise notion of ripe lemon pervades and takes over the entire palate.

Isole e Olena 2010  Chianti Classico,27,96,"This stunning Chianti Classico has an intense perfume of violet, rose and iris, accented with scents of truffle and forest berry.

Eichinger 2014 Gaisberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),28,96,"This wines arrives on tiptoe, citrus-scented and fresh, but once it expands on your palate it soon fills the mouth with all manner of stone fruits. As befits this vintage, everything is tempered with grapefruit zestiness but both mirabelle and apricot richness not only lend flavor but also a beautiful texture that insinuates quince and blood orange zest. What a triumph, what a marvel. Irresistible now but with incredible concentration this is built to last. Drink now till 2020 at least.",Riesling

At one quarter the price of comparable bottles, this young wine just seduces from the instant it hits the tongue.",Chardonnay
Rulo 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,96,"Superb fruit highlights this tight, sculpted Syrah. It's extremely dense, with deep and intense raspberry and cassis fruit flavor, augmented with coffee grounds, smoke and iron filings. Complex, detailed, balanced and deep—what more can a wine give you? This is drinking very young and surely needs to be decanted. But already displaying amazing power.",Syrah
The Eyrie Vineyards 2014 Estate Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),27,96,"Even if winemaker Jason Lett tripled the price of this wine, it would still be a standout among its peers. This opens with intense aromatics of pineapple fruit, bracing acidity and compelling length.

Alvear NV Solera 1927 Pedro Ximénez (Montilla-Moriles),30,96,"One of the world's best PX wines is Solera 1927, the pride of Alvear. Whatever solera stocks went into this bottling were well selected. Aromas of maple and fine wood turn to fig and caramel. Saturation and weight on the palate are expected, but this has some (though not a lot) acidic cut. Deep flavors of fig and Nutella finish with nuttiness and warmth. Drink or hold.",Pedro Ximénez

Julien Schaal 2016 Kastelberg Grand Cru Schiste Riesling (Alsace),25,95,"Chamomile and ripe, red-apple notes make for an appetizing nose.

Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Goldert Grand Cru Muscat (Alsace),26,95,"A flinty touch of promising reduction still hovers on the nose but cheeky floral and fruity hints of honeysuckle, jasmine and peach shimmer through. The palate unites all of these aromatic notions on a textured, layered and concentrated palate. The hints of honeysuckle spice are intensified by the ripe zestiness of Amalfi lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and long, with ample refreshment from these gorgeous citrus notes. This is glorious now in its youthful exuberance but has the concentration, structure and fruit to age beautifully. Drink 2017–2035.",Muscat
Alain Brumont 2010 Château Bouscassé Red (Madiran),20,95,"The home vineyard of Madiran's star, Alain Brumont, has yielded a superb wine that is full of dark tannins and with a considerable ability to age.

Drink from 2018–2038.",Red Blend
Eichinger 2015 Gaisberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),29,95,"Clouds of aromatic flower play along with zesty orange flavors. Grapefruit provides spice and drive. The palate shows that counterpoint of ripeness and tartness that makes this so very moreish. This is juicy and powerful, yet precise and toned despite all its generosity. This is a light, tightrope walk between two thrilling worlds. It's full of life and joy with an endless finish.",Riesling
Abbazia di Novacella 2015 Praepositus Kerner (Alto Adige),25,95,"You'll need to swirl the glass a few times to release the enticing scents of yellow stone fruit, Alpine herb and an intriguing smoky note. The savory vibrant palate is more expressive, delivering layers of crunchy green apple, zesty tangerine and juicy yellow peach set against crisp acidity. A flinty mineral note graces the lingering finish, lending even more depth. Drink through 2020.",Kerner
Domaine Cauhapé 2012 Symphonie de Novembre  (Jurançon),25,95,"Pure Petit Manseng harvested in November has given the essence of Jurançon.

Sineann 2013 Riesling (Oregon),24,95,"This sweet, luscious, dessert-style wine keeps enough acidity to contrast and compensate for the sugar. There's nothing flabby here, but how sweet it is!

A half bottle is rich enough to satisfy four tasters.",Riesling
Au Bon Climat 2007 Santa Barbara Historic Vineyards Collection Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),30,95,"Amazingly rich and ripe, defining the Bien Nacido cool-climate style. The grapes hung for a long time in this excellent vintage, getting ripe and balanced, and the wine offers dazzling opulence, while preserving vital acidity.

Novy 2005 Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),27,95,"Dark and racy, with a Northern Rhône-style aroma of black pepper, cedar and black currants, but there's nothing Rhône-like about the flavor.

Absolutely first-rate Syrah.",Syrah
La Clarine Farm 2011 Cedarville Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills),24,95,"Light in color, alcohol and texture, this dynamic wine has a fresh pepper flavor, and is gorgeous all around, like drinking fresh rose petals.

EOS 2006 Tears of Dew Late Harvest Moscato (Paso Robles),22,95,"With 21% residual sugar, this is an enormously sweet wine, one of the most honeyed of the vintage.

Trisaetum 2014 Wichmann Dundee Estate Riesling (Dundee Hills),28,95,"Details of tea leaf, peach skin and pear introduce a wine with tremendous texture and length.

As with all these young wines, this will improve dramatically with ample aeration.",Riesling
Januik 2012 Bacchus Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,95,"Spectacular is the word that comes to mind here. Tasted over many hours, this stunning effort proved itself over and over.

Rosenhof 2015 Orion Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland),30,95,"The fragrant, absolute varietal purity of green pear and grapefruit zest attains an additional thrill of orange-peel lift. The palate is sweet but not overwhelmingly so: all is balanced and countered by freshness and a light touch. This richness dances on ballerina's tiptoe. That aromatic streak of citrus freshness unites grapefruit and greengage, honey and lime. This is utter purity of fruit in an Eiswein of immense, irresistible charm with moreish, lemon-pure length.",Grüner Veltliner
Koehler 2014 Mourvèdre (Santa Ynez Valley),30,95,"This is a complex and layered Mourvèdre.

Easton 2014 Old Vine Rinaldi Vineyard Zinfandel (Fiddletown),30,95,"A gorgeous aroma like roses and blackberries meets richly concentrated and ripe black-fruit flavors in this full-bodied, luxuriously textured wine.

Melville 2008 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),26,95,"Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple créme brulée, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Totally decadent, and fortunately set off with brisk, citrusy acidity. Calling all lobsters, and don't forget the drawn butter. Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price.",Chardonnay
Au Bon Climat 2007 Los Alamos Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),25,95,"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",Chardonnay
Arrowood 2009 Saralee's Vineyard Viognier (Russian River Valley),30,95,"A brilliant, completely satisfying Viognier that shows its sunny California terroir in the ripe lemon, peach and mango flavors.

Southard 2010 Whipping Boy Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),25,95,"Alcohol that reaches these levels is often a complexity killer, but not here. This is a stunningly delicious wine, with ripe, powerful and concentrated black fruits. Baking spices, tar, pencil lead, even a whiff of compost all add to the complexity and the depth of flavor is magnificent. This can age at least a decade but is delicious already!",Cabernet Sauvignon
Domaines Schlumberger 2009 Kessler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),30,95,"There is both wonderful bite and density to this great wine. It has a weighty texture full of ripe, rich fruit.

Kracher NV Noble Reserve Trockenbeerenauslese White (Burgenland),25,95,"Apple and passion fruit are the aromatic top notes, hovering above a nose of honey and musk. Notes of honey, caramel and maple syrup seem to unite on the palate, guided and framed by the sharpest, most luminous acidity.

Maison Bleue 2009 Soleil Roussanne (Yakima Valley),25,94,"Another stellar effort from this terrific new winery. Luscious aromas—stone fruits, candy, wax, peel, honey, cumin, allspice—it just keeps on going. Firm in the mouth, with the same exotic and refined blend of interesting spices and fruits. A tour de force.",Roussanne
Domaine Laporte 2016 Le Rochoy  (Sancerre),30,94,"From a sloping flinty vineyard, this is an impressive wine.

Drink from 2019.",Sauvignon Blanc
Stottle 2011 Lucille Late Harvest Viognier (Yakima Valley),18,94,"This tastes like a more concentrated and sweeter version of Stottle's dry Viognier from the same vintage and vineyard.

Rosenhof 2012 Orion Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland),30,94,"Subtle notes of candied apricot mingle with barley sugar and light caramel in this splendid Eiswein. The palate reveals more intrigue, with pure lemon zest and aromatic inflections of crushed citrus foliage. While there is ample sweetness, this is cut by razor-sharp freshness and held in perfect poise. With time, ever more flavors join in: baked apple, candied orange peel and passion fruit. In its character, this would suit desserts that major on tropical, exotic fruit.",Grüner Veltliner
Luis Duarte 2008 Rapariga da Quinta Reserva Red (Alentejano),23,94,"His skills show in this rich, powerful, finely balanced wine. It has layers of black berry fruits, damsons, bitter chocolate and a good core of acidity. Give this impressive wine 3–4 years.",Portuguese Red
Tranche 2008 Slice of Pape Blanc Viognier-Roussanne (Columbia Valley (WA)),30,94,"Rich, almost unctuous, with a lush, lanolin mouthfeel, this is a passionfruit creamsicle of a wine. The fruit is a seductive and generous mix of peach, Asian pear and tropical; the alcohol a full-bodied 14.5%. The Roussanne part (58% of the blend) is barrel fermented; the Viognier done in stainless. Blended together they harmonize beautifully.",Viognier-Roussanne
Stéphane Aviron 2014 Côte du Py Vieilles Vignes  (Morgon),24,94,"The Côte du Py, one of the best cru vineyard sites in Beaujolais, is on the slope of a 3,000-foot extinct volcano.

It will certainly need to age, so drink from 2019.",Gamay
Stéphane Aviron 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Moulin-à-Vent),24,94,"Be grateful that Stéphane Aviron is an old-vine hunter.

Medium to full bodied, it tastes great now and will improve through 2020.",Zinfandel
Amity 2013 Riesling (Willamette Valley),22,94,"The deep gold color of this relatively young wine suggests that oxidation is setting in. But wait! This wine explodes into full glory 24 hours after first being opened. It begins with intense aromas and flavors of dried apricots, apples and a hint of ginger, showing impressive length on the finish. It turns into a breathtaking, spätlese-style effort on the palate, with honey, Meyer lemon and ripe grapefruit flavors.",Riesling
Eichinger 2013 Gaisberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),28,94,"This wine pulls off a daring feat: despite palate weight and concentration it has a light, almost delicate, feathery citrus touch and a streamlined, fresh palate. The aromatic expression is just beginning to unfold, promising freshly cut apples and oceans of green and dried spice. This should carry a danger-warning: seriously, deliciously addictive! Beautiful now but it deserves maturing. Drink as of 2016–2017.",Grüner Veltliner
Eichinger 2013 Gaisberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),28,94,"Voluptuous notions of orange oil segue into a more earthy notion of lemon-anointed autumn leaves.

Bründlmayer 2013 Alte Reben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),25,94,"Creamy, rounded freshness with an immensely savory core of sage, arugula and white pepper make for an understated but seriously delicious white.

Domaines Schlumberger 2014 Kessler Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),30,94,"There is something pleasantly bitter on the nose: Burnt sugar or bitter almond. The palate answers this with fluid, rippling sweetness expressed in ripe, juicy, refreshing pear fruit. The bitter notes remain and create an appetizing, tangy edge to this concentrated wine that is streamlined by balancing freshness despite the residual sugar. A lovely balancing act with a bracingly clean, medium dry finish and echoes of citrus zest. Drink 2017–2035.",Pinot Gris

Drink now.",Portuguese Red
Rosenhof 2013 Ausbruch Traminer (Burgenland),30,94,"The whole world of apricots is represented here: fresh, candied and dried. The concentration on the palate is immense, the scent is disarming, the sweetness is beyond luscious. Aromatic blood-orange peel and flesh provide an equally fragrant counterbalance.

Trisaetum 2015 Coast Range Estate Riesling,28,94,"Technically off dry, this has so much defining acidity that the sweetness is just detectable, serving principally to round out the lush fruits.

Osborne NV Pedro Ximenez 1827 Sweet Sherry Sherry (Jerez),14,94,"A spectacularly sweet and rich bruiser, and one that delivers the essence of raisins, toffee and chocolate. This wine hasn't taken one turn south, and it's beckoning to be consumed.

Dopff & Irion 2012 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),28,94,"That ethereal herbal lift of fine Riesling is apparent with the very first whiff. These wonderfully herb-scented notions continue on the exemplary dry palate: Imagine a lick of scented, dried chamomile embracing notions of dried and fresh apple and citrus peel. A wonderfully harmonious synthesis of fresh and evolved flavors. If you need convincing of the mature charm of Riesling this is the wine to convince you: Elegant, understated and yet intense. The finish is dry, sustained and utterly moreish. Lovely and maturing now, but with further potential. Drink 2017–2030.",Riesling
Domaine Fernand Engel 2014 Praelatenberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),30,94,"Earth, apple, citrus and herb all mingle on nose. Green apple tinged with chamomile edge strikes against bright lemon on the dry palate. This is full of refreshing citrus and a beautifully understated vigor which will live in this wine for years to come. The finish culminates in a gorgeously tart but ripe apple notion. Very moreish now and approachable but with lots of future promise. Drink 2017–2030.",Riesling
Eighty Four 2015 Albariño (Napa Valley),28,94,"This new project of Elias Fernandez and Doug Shafer, of Shafer Vineyards, continues to impress with this standout white, sourced from Carneros, where the duo planted four acres of the variety a few years back. It's achingly pretty and substantive—exotic, complex and lingering, with sizzling acidity. Peach and honeysuckle stand out, while the texture is so sublime, you'll simply want more.",Albariño
Cusumano 2014 Alta Mora  (Etna),25,94,"Enticing scents of wild red berry, baking spice, aromatic herb and a balsamic note waft out of the glass. The elegant, juicy palate doles out succulent wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and a note of white pepper while a mineral note backs up the finish. It's well balanced, with bright acidity and ultrafine tannins.",Red Blend
Salwey 2012 Estate Dry Pinot Noir (Baden),25,94,"Exotic spice and cedar notes mingle amidst plump red cherries and raspberries on the nose of this perfumed Pinot Noir. Firm tannins form a taut foundation to crisp, tart raspberry and currant flavors and savory nuances of dried herb and crushed granite. It's a remarkably elegant, squarely structured wine that should meld beautifully over the next decade.",Pinot Noir
Rex Hill 2012 Jacob-Hart Vineyard Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),30,94,"An astonishing Pinot Gris, certainly among the best ever made in Oregon, this rich, luscious, mouthcoating wine is totally irresistible.

Quinta dos Murças 2011 Assobio Red (Douro),13,94,"Assobio is from a single vineyard in the Quinta dos Murças estate. A powerful, structured expression of Douro wine, it has black fruits, dark tannins, some subtle layers of wood aging and great concentration. Dark and richly fruity, it needs to mature before drinking. Wait until 2017.",Portuguese Red
Jean-Luc Baldès 2012 Clos Triguedina Les Galets Malbec (Cahors),30,94,"The highest of the Cahors vineyard's three terraces above the Lot valley has its stony soil with large pebbles. It produces the most structured of the three single-parcel wines from Triguedina. Complex and dark, it is juicy and sumptuous as well as solidly structured. Great acidity cuts through the opulent texture. It's a wine to age; drink from 2019.",Malbec
Le Casematte 2014 Peloro Red (Terre Siciliane),20,94,"Made with 70% Nerello Mascalese and 30% Nocera, this has enticing scents of mature red berry, pressed blue flower, tilled soil and a whiff of crushed stone. The vibrant palate doles out juicy black cherry, raspberry compote, orange zest and bitter hazelnut. Bright acidity and well-integrated tannins provide balance while a mineral note gives it depth. Drink 2020–2030.",Red Blend
Château des Jacques 2015  Morgon,28,94,"This is a finely structured wine that will age well.

From the cru estate that is owned by Louis Jadot in Beaune, it is impressive and worth aging. Drink from 2018.",Gamay
Eder 2015 Süssenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),29,94,"Beautifully pure notions of sun-ripened mirabelle plum appear on the nose, edged with aromatic hints of ivy and herb.

This is pristine and beautiful, lasting and impressive. The finish shines with the expressive purity.",Grüner Veltliner
Mollie 2014 Zotovich Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),30,94,"Lovely white-flower aromas of lily, tuberose and plumeria are elegant and engaging without being overpowering. These pair nicely with the light mango, crushed sea shell and petrol touch of the nose. Coconut, both dried flakes and milk, shows strongly on the creamy sip, along with honeysuckle, pineapple and fragrant white fruit.",Chardonnay
Center of Effort 2012 Chardonnay (Edna Valley),30,94,"This phenomenal bottling from the winemaking team of Mike Sinor and Nathan Carlson hits the nose with a judicious touch of vanilla-laced buttercream as well as scorched lemon slices and orange peels. It's playfully lithe on the palate, with just a touch of oak warmth, racy acidity, chalky grip and a faint hint of dill. It's great for now, but will age with nutty style thanks to the balancing tensions.",Chardonnay
Alma Rosa 2006 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),20,94,"Starts with an opulent, inviting aroma of smoky honey, vanilla, tangerines, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots, green apples and minerals. In the mouth, the flavors are very similar—an explosion of fruits, spices and toast. Just a tremendous wine, but for all the volume and complexity, it's completely balanced.",Chardonnay
Trisaetum 2012 Ribbon Ridge Estate Dry Riesling (Ribbon Ridge),24,94,"The Ribbon Ridge estate delivers beautifully ripened fruit—so ripe, in fact, that the first impression is of sweet tree fruits, although the wine is actually quite dry. Peaches, citrus and nectarines are in the mix, and when the tangy acidity kicks in, a long, mineral-driven ride across the palate ensues. Luscious, long and detailed, this is a spectacular Riesling.",Riesling
Eichinger 2014 Gaisberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),28,94,"On the nose, aromas of russet apple and pear skin mingle with fresh citrus zest and a hint of ripe pear. The palate underlines the ripe fruit which is bedded in a soft but very fresh and concentrated core of savory yeast. Each layer shimmers with fruit, freshness and spice. The palate has a real dynamic energy and is lovely now but will be even lovelier in two or three years' time.",Grüner Veltliner
Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2014 Rosenberg Pinot Gris (Alsace),28,94,"Yeasty funk still obscures the aromas on the nose. The palate, however, speaks of fluid freshness, of richness and power channelled into precision and softness. The palate is bone dry and we can thus witness the brightness of the fresh acidity counteract masterfully with the richness of a balm-like textured body, leaving a streamlined and elegant Pinot Gris. The length just gets you.",Pinot Gris
Rodney Strong 2014 Cooley Ranch Syrah (North Coast),30,94,"This wine impresses from first sip. The addition of 20% Viognier adds violet and lilac hints to the nose. Meat and lavender notes highlight its dense midpalate, packed with flavor and gravelly texture, blanketed with tannin and seasoned with white pepper and clove.",Syrah
Timothy Malone 2016 Medici Vineyard Riesling (Chehalem Mountains),20,94,"In 2016, Tim Malone has cut back on the residual sugar, dropping it down to 12 g/L, meaning the wine is just slightly off dry. The old-vine flavors rock on through, delivering big bursts of honeydew, grapefruit and lime, underscored by minerals. The depth, length and succulent drinkability are sublime.",Riesling
Gini 2015 La Froscà  (Soave Classico),29,94,"Hands down one of Italy's best whites, this boasts alluring white flower and yellow stone fruit scents.

Treana 2006 Mer Soleil Vineyard White (Central Coast),25,94,"Treana has enjoyed great success with this blend of Viognier and Marsanne, which is one of the best Rhône-style white wines in California. The main reason is the source of the grapes. The vineyard, owned by the Wagners of Caymus, is stellar. The '06 is as rich and crisply acidic as ever, with fantastically complex, honeyed tropical fruit, apricot and floral flavors that taste like they have a touch of botrytis.",Rhône-style White Blend
Trisaetum 2013 Ribbon Ridge Estate Dry Riesling (Ribbon Ridge),24,94,"This dry wine from the Ribbon Ridge vineyard, adjacent to the winery, is briskly tart without being sour. Flavors of lemony tea and Meyer lemon meringue intrigue immediately. There is splendid structure and complexity in play here, with layers of flower, citrus and mineral, all in perfect harmony.

Dutton-Goldfield 2015 Dutton Ranch Green Valley Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Green Valley),30,94,"Juicy acidity buoys layers of wet stone, crisp apple and white peach in this lovely aromatic white.

Monte da Ravasqueira 2013 Vinha das Romãs Red (Alentejano),28,94,"Blending Syrah and Touriga Franca, this is the flagship wine from this property.

Adriano Marco & Vittorio 2013 Sanadaive  (Barbaresco),30,94,"Enticing scents of fragrant blue flower, ripe red berry, baking spice, menthol and new leather lead the way.

Sineann 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),30,94,"Rich, ripe and concentrated, the lush array of black fruits is enhanced with a generous amount of barrel-generated baking spices.

Sol Rouge 2011 Gypsy Rouge Estate Red (Red Hills Lake County),28,94,"Take a walk on the wild side with this Rhône-style blend. It has wonderful, concentrated, meaty flavors backing up the wild, savory, slightly earthy aromas.

Blended from 76% Grenache, plus five other Rhône varietals.",Rhône-style Red Blend
Kevin White 2012 La Fraternité G-S-M (Yakima Valley),28,94,"This blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah presents a lively, aromatic mix of raspberries, Kirsch and strawberry preserves, with pitch-perfect structure and balance.

Château de Gaudou 2012 Le Sang de la Vigne Malbec (Cahors),30,94,"Hugely rich, this was fermented in egg-shaped cuves that have given an impressively rounded character to a wine still so young. The tannins are opulent, letting the black fruits speak powerfully. It still is a wine to age, so drink after 2019.",Malbec
Domaine Cauhapé 2011 Symphonie de Novembre  (Jurançon),18,94,"A rich, sweet wine that maintains complete freshness. Pineapple, peach and mango compose the fruit, while the honey and touch of botrytis give the sweetness. It has a refreshing youthful character, but it's going to be a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",Petit Manseng
Kevin White 2012 En Hommage G-S-M (Columbia Valley (WA)),28,94,"Principally Syrah, this includes 15% Grenache and 3% Mourvèdre.

Nittnaus Anita und Hans 2006 TBA White (Burgenland),27,94,"Vanilla and banana jelly, manuka honey and muscovado sugar—layer upon layer of fruity sweetness with tropical overtones of pineapple is revealed on the luscious palate.

This wine has a beautiful structure, elegance and mesmerizing depth.",Sangiovese
Côte Bonneville 2013 DuBrul Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),22,94,"This hides its 37 g/L residual sugar with bracing acidity and overall complexity. A dense run of ripe fruits—Meyer lemon, sweet pineapple, orange, tangerine and papaya—carries an interesting black tea note. The sweetness is detailed and complex, with honey and ginger candy flavors.",Riesling
Tamarack Cellars 2012 Dionysus Vineyard Petit Verdot (Columbia Valley (WA)),30,94,"Fans of Petit Verdot, which has almost attained cult status in Washington, will not want to miss this spectacular effort. Bright, chewy and muscular though it is, the tannins have been polished perfectly, and set off with 40% new oak, adding dark, smoky chocolate and espresso flavors. The acidity keeps up, underscoring tart berry fruit with some sweet green-tomato highlights.",Petit Verdot
Biecher & Schaal 2014 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),30,94,"Ripe Mirabelle plums and tart, red apples mix to give a very fruity, appetizing aspect which on the palate is joined by ripe, lemony freshness.

Lovely Mirabelle finish of immense length. Drink 2016–2026.",Riesling
Penner-Ash 2014 Viognier (Oregon),30,94,"This wine just bowls you over from the first sniff, a lush mix of white flower and citrus-rind aromatics.

Domaine Berthoumieu 2007 Charles de Batz Tannat (Madiran),25,94,"Tannat at its most expressive, this wine boasts dense tannins that roll deeply around the wine. But the fruit is of such an intensity that it keeps up a fine equilibrium. It is a seamless, impressive wine, projecting its power easily.",Tannat
Domaine G. Metz 2012 Muenchberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),22,94,"The nose is shy but promises development with its heady note of chamomile. The palate reinforces this soothing, herbal and balm-like feeling even more, seemingly dissolving dried chamomile aromas in a sea of fluid, fresh lemon. The palate is absolutely dry and comes with a wonderful lightness of touch. Despite the ripeness of the 2012 vintage this has ease and a spring in its step. This wine is lovely now and will continue to evolve for a long time. Concentration will make sure of that. Drink 2017–2030.",Riesling
Domaine G. Metz 2014 Muenchberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),22,94,"This combination of tingling grapefruit spice, pure lemon and leafy lemon balm on the nose is utterly disarming. The touch of green apple makes it even more alluring. The palate jumbles all of these fresh, lithe, bright and appetizing flavors together and swirls them across the palate on a joyous, light-footed lemon sweep. Oh for the pleasure of Riesling in a vintage that majors on freshness rather than ripeness. This dances on the tongue with its dryness, purity and aromatic ease. Underneath all that is concentration and a stony, firm core that anchors this in quality. A lovely, promising and utterly charming wine. Drink 2017–2030.",Riesling
Domaine Michel Fonne 2012 Marckrain Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),26,94,"Superripe mirabelles and the juiciest pears appear on the nose and fill the mind with heady perfume. The palate confirms this notion of sweetness with ample residual sugar. However, this is met with precise acidity to create unusual thrill. This just sits on a knife's edge between juicy ripe pear and mouth-watering grapefruit zest—a wonderful interplay of notions that makes this incredibly enticing. This is starting to develop and has way to go with its playful, medium-dry finish. Drink 2017–2030.",Pinot Gris
Domaine Saint-Rémy 2015 Ehrhart Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),30,94,"Wet stone and lemon set the tone when it comes to scent. The palate falls in with these themes and presents precision and poise; the razor-sharp freshness of lemon zest is both brightening and deliciously bracing. This is a svelte but concentrated wine of great purity that has not really come into its own yet. It is perfumed now but one cannot help but suspect much more development of aroma in the future. All the potential, concentration and balance is there. The finish is dry and lemony. Drink 2017–2030.",Riesling
Domaines Schlumberger 2014 Spiegel Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),30,94,"Dried lemon peel and honey create a very appealing nose. The palate displays generous fruit balanced by the disciplined structure provided by lively acidity. Glimpses of ripe pear and honeycomb show on the edges, while the medium-dry finish is immensely appetizing. Though it's lovely now, it shows long-term potential, and should hold well through 2030.",Pinot Gris
Rosenhof 2014 Trockenbeerenauslese Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland),30,94,The bitter-edged sweetness of botrytis counters the luscious notes of orange marmalade. The palate is of immense richness and has a tart gilded richness of candied orange peel and a concentrated pleasant bitterness that is so addictive. There are glints of white pepper. The purest citrus acid runs like a fault line through the wine. This is lovely and luscious now but really made to last. This will age and develop indefinitely. Drink now until 2030 at least.,Grüner Veltliner
Kracher 2013 Auslese Cuvée White (Burgenland),23,94,"The scent of apricot jam is exquisitely pure on the nose, with an added glimpse of orange zest.

Galerie 2015 Terracea Riesling (Spring Mountain District),30,94,"Subdued floral aromatics open this delightfully complex, dry wine, lilting in lemon, green apple and stone.

D'Arenberg 2008 The Noble Wrinkled Riesling (McLaren Vale),19,94,"Lovely dessert-style Riesling at an extremely attractive price. It yields dried apricot aromas, then turns to honeyed marmalade in the mouth, just loaded with orange-apricot preserves. It's weighty and viscous, with a long, sweet finish. Should last through at least 2016.",Riesling
Contucci 2009  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,29,94,"This is a classically crafted wine made by one of Montepulciano's most historic estates. It has an alluring bouquet of violet, rose petal, cassis and nutmeg.

Caffo Beverages Inc, Kiwi Distributing.",Red Blend
Novy 2005 Syrah (Russian River Valley),27,94,"Beautiful, irresistable Syrah, lush and sweet in fruit and oak. Soft and velvety, it offers layers of puréed raspberries, cherries, blackberries, blueberries and chocolate, with a rich edge of toasted marshmallow, gingerbread and butterscotch. Yet it's dry, with modest alcohol.",Syrah
Robert Karl 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),29,94,"This is Washington Syrah at its most distinctive. The fruit stands out with tart and tangy flavors of boysenberry, raspberry and a tartness reminiscent of cranberry. There are streaks of meat, smoke and bacon, and the acids are clean. This is a glorious food wine, but so juicy, assertive and delicious that it almost demands to be drunk on its own. Will it evolve in the cellar? Probably, but it's hard to keep your hands off it long enough to find out.",Syrah
Trisaetum 2011 Ribbon Ridge Estate Riesling (Ribbon Ridge),24,94,"Perhaps the best of a stellar lineup from Trisaetum, this off-dry estate bottling is packed with grapefruit and pineapple flavors. They run tart and deep into the palate, full and focused, with the vineyard's signature minerality.",Riesling
Poet's Leap 2012 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,94,"Half of this year's Poet's Leap Riesling is sourced from The Benches, one quarter from old-vine plantings at Dionysus, and the rest from Yakima's Phil Church vineyard.

Delicious young, it could also be cellared for a decade or longer.",Riesling
Alvear NV Solera 1927 Pedro Ximénez (Montilla-Moriles),25,94,"A rank well above most PX sweeties, with lush but fresh aromas of raisin and spice that are distinctly not syrupy or heavy. Feels thick, but there's enough acidity to cut through the wine's weight. Flavors of caramel and chocolate are ideal, and the finish is smooth, not heavy, and has bounce in its step. A beautiful PX any way you cut it.",Pedro Ximénez
Guardian 2012 Angel Sauvignon Blanc (Red Mountain),20,94,"This is as good as Sauvignon Blanc gets in Washington—a dense, pungent, intensely aromatic and gloriously flavorful wine sourced entirely from the Klipsun Vineyard. Inaugural scents suggest wet hay, new-mown grass, fig and citrus. Following are flavors of pineapple, more citrus, beeswax and a suggestion of bee pollen. This is one of those bottles that empties much faster than you'd like.",Sauvignon Blanc
Carlisle 2015 Compagni Portis White (Sonoma Valley),30,94,"An old-vine field blend of Gewürztraminer, Trousseau Gris and Riesling, this vintage is tiny in production but boldly delicious in flavor and intent.

Domaines Dominique Piron 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Moulin-à-Vent),20,94,"Wonderful old vines facing south and south-east give a powerfully tannic, structured wine. They also give great black fruits, spice and a toasty edge from the wood aging. This is a dense wine with a serious future. Drink from 2020.",Gamay
Fox Run 2011 Reserve Riesling (Seneca Lake),30,94,"Extended bottle aging and impeccable fruit ripeness make this late-release Riesling an absolute showstopper. Wafting of honey, mango and grapefruit, this deeply concentrated wine saturates the palate in dense, creamy waves. Shimmering lime and mineral streaks elevate the midpalate and extend endlessly on the finish. It's stunning now, but composed enough to hold well until at least 2025.",Riesling
Eighty Four 2016 Albariño (Napa Valley),28,94,"This strengthens the argument that there's a place for different kinds of white wines to be made in the Napa Valley, emphasizing fruit freshness and acidity without sacrificing flavor or soul. Juicy apricot and green apple ride a wave of unoaked refreshment and refinement, all within a crisp framework of deliciousness. Lavender and honeysuckle seduce quietly.",Albariño
Tre Monti 2015 Vitalba in Anfora Albana (Romagna),24,94,"Fermented in clay amphora, this fascinating orange wine opens with alluring aromas of dried yellow stone fruit, baking spice, aromatic herb, pressed yellow flower and a balsamic note. Boasting more fruit and flavor than many other wines in this genre, the savory enveloping palate presents apricot, yellow peach, candied nectarine zest, crystallized ginger and a hint of flinty mineral. Tangy acidity provides balance and lift while a honeyed note closes the lingering finish. Simply gorgeous.",Albana
Jax 2014 Y3 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),25,94,"It's hard not to jump up and down about the outstanding value represented here, a wine made from Dutton Ranch fruit that's juicy and generous in baked strawberry, earth and rose petals. A grippy structure provides weight around nuanced, spicy cherry-pie flavor and plenty of body to satisfy.",Pinot Noir
Treana 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),30,94,"For lovers of the rich and ripe Paso Robles style, this is a high-value wine. Aromas of candied black cherry and vanilla pudding meet with roasted game and crushed gravel on the nose. Vanilla holds strong into the palate, where it blends with blueberry syrup and blackened caramel. Well-measured acidity and chalky tannins complete the experience.",Cabernet Sauvignon
Winzerkeller Andau 2015 Beerenauslese Scheurebe (Burgenland),24,94,"Honey and barley sugar dance on the nose. They also vie for attention on the unctuous palate where their rich and decadent sweetness is revealed. This, however, is countered by an acidic thrill of pure lemon, suggesting candied lemon peel in a sea of rich caramel. A touch of passion fruit can be glimpsed, too. The interaction between these opposing poles creates tension in this lip-smacking, lemony- bright wine.",Scheurebe
Melville 2013 Verna's Syrah (Santa Barbara County),28,94,"This is likely the last vintage from this vineyard, which the family winery seemingly mastered in this bottling. There's an underlying umami-driven smoked meat backbone to the nose that also shows bold cherry blossom, olallieberry, pepper, dried herbs and blackberry-soy sauce. The palate is complex yet doesn't overpower, with bits of purple flowers, blueberry, black pepper and menthol.",Syrah
Domaine Cauhapé 2010 Symphonie de Novembre  (Jurançon),24,94,"Concentrated and luscious, this has notes of dried apricot and fig, with a dense texture reminiscent of honey and orange marmalade. It has a strong mineral structure that melds with the ripe generosity. Savor this intense wine alone at the end of a meal or with blue cheese.",Petit Manseng
Quady NV Batch 88 Starboard Red (California),24,94,"Made from traditional Portuguese varieties, this is one of the best California Port-style wines out there, which is no surprise coming as it does from sweet wine specialist Quady.

A great success at a good price for a full, not a half, bottle.",Red Blend
Dunham 2009 Lewis Estate Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),20,94,"Even by Dunham's high standards, this is a spectacular Riesling.

This wine just rocks.",Riesling
Uvaggio 2010 Secco Moscato Giallo (Lodi),16,94,"This dry Moscato Giallo from Lodi is delicious, with an intensely perfumed nose that follows through in the taste, alongside Meyer lemon, jasmine and cantaloupe. Very unusual, incredibly well priced and modest in alcohol, this lush, ginger-tinged Moscato is this taster's desert-island white.",Moscato Giallo
Pagos del Moncayo 2009 Syrah (Campo de Borja),30,94,"This varietal Syrah from the land of Garnacha is downright superb, and for $30 it qualifies as an outstanding value. Black cherry and ripe berry aromas are big and inviting, while the palate is thick, layered and still racy due to fine acidity. Flavors of blackberry, chocolate, vanilla and baking spice run for miles on the generous finish. Drink now–2016.",Syrah
Mark Ryan 2009 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),28,94,"Beautiful craftsmanship is on display in this mélange of mouth-coating butterscotch, Meyer lemon and sweet citrus flavors. It's rich without being at all tiring, and the lengthy and succulent fruit flavors keep adding details, such as hints of cucumber and herb.",Chardonnay
Charles Sparr 2013 Brand Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),24,94,"An incredibly creamy notion of ripe pear rises from the glass. There are also hints of sultana. The aromatic effect is one of huge generosity. The palate, on the other hand, is taut and medium dry, corralling its richness with pleasantly bitter texture and pervading freshness. There is utter concentration, immense verve and freshness. A delicious and moreish contrast between utter precision and the abandon of generosity. The finish is long, dry and fresh.",Pinot Gris
